# DiagonAlleyMCPack
The Diagon Alley Minecraft Resource Pack


Notice: I'm not active in the Minecraft Community any more, so Updates may or may not arrive in the Future. I further updated the Diagon Alley Pack to feature the GNU v3 license, allowing for further modification and more uses, as I'm fine with them. Be free to modify the pack and publish the modified pack. I had another few updates to the pack planned, so I might do these at one point.

 

Do you are building a Diagon Alley Build in Minecraft? This Resource Pack might help you, you can test it if you want

This is still in Beta, there might be some bugs, it would be good, if you say them to me
